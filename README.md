# M3C-2019
Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge 2019. Group project done by Aneek Barua, Chris Chan, Danyil Blyschak, Inko Bovenzi, and Jeremy Kim.

The question was on the recent epidemic of vaping and e-cigarettes, especially in the non-smoking community.
Various parts of the problem asked to run statistical analysis on whether or not someone was at risk of smoking
as well as if they would pick up vaping or e-cigarettes with no prior smoking history. 

We were also asked to observe the sale-rate and general trends on e-cigarettes as a result of various
bans that could take place, including individual devices/pods vs. full vape mods and other parts, such
as e-juice and batteries.
